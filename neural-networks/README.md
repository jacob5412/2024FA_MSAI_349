# Instructions

To test the neural network on the best hyperparameters, run the following files:
* `train_test_q1.py`
* `train_test_q2.py`
* `train_test_q3.py`
* `train_test_q4_v1.py`
* `train_test_q4_v2.py`

The results will be in the folder `results` as `.png` files. Question 4 contains two different approaches towards manually updating weights.

You can also choose to search through all the hyperparameters using the following files. However, we strongly advise **against it** given the amount of time it takes to run the search:
* `hyperparams_search_q1.py`
* `hyperparams_search_q2.py`
* `hyperparams_search_q3.py`
* `hyperparams_search_q4_v1.py`
* `hyperparams_search_q4_v2.py`

The results will be in the `hyperparams` folder as `.png` and `.csv` files.
